## Marvel Universe Social Network

Visualization of [the Social characteristics of the Marvel Universe](http://bioinfo.uib.es/~joemiro/marvel.html) using [the Javascript Infovis Toolkit](http://thejit.org/) (JIT).

**See the Visualization: [Marvel Social Network Graph](http://stungeye.com/viz/marvel/marvel.html).**

The provided Ruby script takes the data provided by [Joe Miro, Cesc Rossell√≥, Ricardo Alberich](http://bioinfo.uib.es/~joemiro/marvel.html) and the [Marvel Chronology Project](http://www.chronologyproject.com/) and formats it for use with a [JIT Force-Directed Graph](http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/ForceDirected/example1.html).

The graph shows the "social network" of characters from the Marvel comic book universe. The lines (edges) between characters nodes represent shared comic-book apperances.

## Examples

[Example screen capture](https://github.com/stungeye/marvel_social_network/raw/master/examples/example1.png) with the constants in prep_data.rb set to:

APPEARANCE_THRESHOLD = 600        
SHARED_APPERANCE_THRESHOLD = 0    
FRIEND_TO_LINEWIDTH_SCALE = 1000 

Change SHARED_APPERANCE_THRESHOLD to 600 and you get [this screen capture](https://github.com/stungeye/marvel_social_network/raw/master/examples/example2.png).

In both cases I have manually tweaked the positions of the nodes.
